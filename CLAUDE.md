# B4 Browse — project index

Windows desktop utility (C# WinForms) that verifies the network and OS are in a safe
state before browsing. Two jobs: (1) confirm the network path is clean — no rogue proxy,
no DNS hijack/spoof; (2) surface files/extensions/programs/processes/services/drivers that
changed recently but don't line up with a Windows patch date. Runs a Safety Scan on startup
and presents results across sortable, color-coded tabs. Also runs headless to print a
plain-text report. See `README.md` for the user-facing feature tour.

- **Framework:** .NET 10 (`net10.0-windows`), WinForms, nullable + implicit usings enabled.
- **Namespace / assembly:** `B4Browse`. Single project, flat directory (no subfolders).
- **Author:** Dennis Lang — LanDen Labs (2026). Apache-2.0.

## Build & run

```pwsh
dotnet build                       # or open B4Browse.sln in Visual Studio
dotnet run                         # launch the GUI (Safety Scan runs on first show)
B4Browse.exe --run <scope>       # headless: run checks, print text report to stdout
B4Browse.exe --report            # alias for --run scan
B4Browse.exe --inventory         # alias for --run all
B4Browse.exe --run events --out events.txt   # also write report to a file
```

Scopes: `scan, dns, arp, patches, chrome, settings, services, processes, startup, scheduled,
installed, devices, winext, events, activity, downloads, firewall, virus, restores, users, all` (the
catalog in `Reports.cs` is the source of truth). `events` needs Administrator to read the Security log;
`downloads` needs Administrator to read the SRUM database; `virus` reads protection state without
elevation but needs Administrator for the Defender threat/scan history (the event log); `users` lists
local accounts without elevation but needs Administrator for true creation dates (Security event 4720;
otherwise the profile-folder age is used as an approximate first-logon proxy).

`install.bat` publishes a self-contained single-file exe (`win-x64`) and copies it to
`c:\opt\bin`. All runtime assets (icon, brand images, links page) are embedded, so the
single file is portable.

## Architecture

The whole app is built on one small data model and a central catalog:

- **`CheckResult.cs`** — the model. `CheckStatus` enum (`Pass/Warn/Fail/Info`),
  `CheckResult` (one line: status + name + detail, or a pre-formatted `Table` row), and
  `CheckGroup` (a titled list of results; `Worst()` rolls up severity, table rows excluded).
- **`SafetyChecks`** — all diagnostic logic, a `static partial class` split across 15
  files (see below). Every public `CheckXxx()` method returns a populated `CheckGroup`
  and is safe to call from a background thread.
- **`Reports.cs`** — central catalog mapping each scope key → its `Func<CheckGroup>[]`
  producers, in display order. `Reports.Build(scope)` runs the producers and formats the
  plain-text report (isolating each check so one failure becomes a `[FAIL]` line, not an
  abort). Shared by the headless runner and the email feature. **Add a new check here**
  to wire it into both headless reports and (via the same catalog) the UI tabs.
- **`Program.cs`** — entry point. Parses `--run/--report/--inventory/--out/--help`;
  headless paths call `Reports.Build`. GUI path loads `Theme` then runs `MainForm`.
  Re-attaches to the parent console (`AttachConsole`) so a WinExe app can print headless
  output to the terminal.

### UI layer
- **`MainForm.cs`** — main window: verdict banner, toolbar (Launch Chrome, Email tab,
  Copy), collapsible left panel of Windows Security deep-links, and a `TabControl` where
  each tab is a `ResultsView`.
- **`ResultsView.cs`** — a single tab: runs its set of checks on a background thread and
  renders the resulting `CheckGroup`s.
- **`TabViews.cs`** — the large file (per-tab grid construction + right-click context
  menus: verify signature, VirusTotal-by-hash, copy path, open the relevant Windows
  console, etc.). One `ShowXxxMenu` per item type.
- **`SortableGrid.cs`** — custom sortable, themeable grid control used by the tabs.
- **`TabHelp.cs` / `TabSeverity.cs` / `Help.cs` / `AboutForm.cs` / `BusyOverlay.cs`** —
  per-tab help text, severity legend, help/about dialogs, busy overlay.
- **`ErrorLogDialog.cs`** — modal viewer for `ErrorLog`: a themed ListView of background-action
  failures (time / category / source / message + detail), Copy/Clear, live-refreshes while open.
  Opened from the `⚠ N errors` badge in the `MainForm` status bar (hidden at 0).
- **`Theme.cs`** — light/dark theme (toggle bottom-left); loaded before any window shows.

### SafetyChecks partials (the checks)
| File | Produces |
| --- | --- |
| `SafetyChecks.cs` | DNS servers, lookups, cross-resolver, email DNS, well-known resolver table |
| `SafetyChecks.Network.cs` | Router/gateway, upstream resolver, proxy, hosts file |
| `SafetyChecks.Posture.cs` | Time sync, Windows Security state |
| `SafetyChecks.System.cs` | OS / patch posture |
| `SafetyChecks.DnsCache.cs` | Live resolver cache (`ipconfig /displaydns`) + flush |
| `SafetyChecks.Arp.cs` | ARP cache |
| `SafetyChecks.ChromePrefs.cs` | Chrome exe integrity, privacy prefs, extensions |
| `SafetyChecks.ChromeSettings.cs` | Chrome settings matrix (settings × profiles + policy Global col) — the Settings tab |
| `SafetyChecks.Inventory.cs` | Services, processes, startup, installed, devices (largest) |
| `SafetyChecks.Scheduled.cs` | Task Scheduler entries + hijack audit (Temp/LOLBin/hidden) — the Scheduled tab |
| `SafetyChecks.Winget.cs` | winget-sourced install metadata |
| `SafetyChecks.WinExt.cs` | Shell / context-menu extensions |
| `SafetyChecks.Firewall.cs` | Firewall state + rules |
| `SafetyChecks.Events.cs` | Windows Event Log entries |
| `SafetyChecks.Activity.cs` | App launch counts (Windows Search `AppsIndex.db`) + PCA last-run merge |
| `SafetyChecks.Sru.cs` | Per-app network bytes sent/received from SRUM (`SRUDB.dat`, via esentutl + ManagedEsent) — the Downloads tab |
| `SafetyChecks.Defender.cs` | Defender protection state (WMI `MSFT_MpComputerStatus`) + threat/scan history (Defender Operational event log) — the Virus tab |
| `SafetyChecks.SecurityCenter.cs` | Windows Security Center (`root\SecurityCenter2`) registered antivirus/firewall products — feeds the Virus tab (alternate AV, e.g. CrowdStrike) and the Firewall tab (third-party firewall provider) |
| `SafetyChecks.Restore.cs` | System Restore points |
| `SafetyChecks.Users.cs` | Local user accounts (`Get-LocalUser`) + Administrators membership, hidden/`SpecialAccounts`, layered creation date (event 4720 → profile-folder ctime → unknown) — the Users tab |

### Row model / DTO classes
One small record-like class per item type, consumed by the grids:
`AppActivity`, `ArpEntry`, `ChromeExtension`, `DeviceDriver`, `DnsCacheEntry`, `EventItem`,
`FirewallRule`, `InstalledProgram`, `ProcessItem`, `RestorePoint`, `ScheduledTaskItem`,
`ServiceInfo`, `ShellExtension`, `SruNetUsage`, `StartupItem`, `UserAccount`. The Settings tab uses a small matrix model
instead (`ChromeSettingsMatrix.cs`: `ChromeSettingsMatrix` / `SettingRow` / `ColumnDef`). The
Virus tab uses `DefenderModels.cs`: `DefenderStatusSummary` (WMI state), `ThreatDetectionRecord` /
`ScanHistoryRecord` (parsed events), and `DefenderTimelineRow` (the merged grid row).

### Helpers
- `Elevation.cs` — admin/elevation detection.
- `EmbeddedAssets.cs` — load embedded icon/images (works inside the single-file exe).
- `InfAnalyzer.cs` — parse/analyze driver `.inf` files (driver tab "Analyze INF").
- `ReportMailer.cs` — "Email this tab (Chrome)".
- `ShellExtension.cs` — shell-extension lookup support.
- `ErrorLog.cs` — process-wide, thread-safe, bounded in-memory sink for background-action
  failures (`ErrorCategory` Timeout/ParseError/Error, `ErrorEntry`, `Changed` event,
  `Count`/`Snapshot`/`Clear`). No-throw, so logging never perturbs the failure it records. The
  three diagnostic runners (`RunPowerShellJson`, `RunPowerShellArray`, `RunCapture`) and the
  `Reports.Build` producer-exception catch feed it; viewed via `ErrorLogDialog`.

## Versioning — keep in sync

Version lives in several places; **do not hand-edit them individually**.
`set-version.ps1` is the single source that rewrites all of them on release:
- `AppInfo.cs` (`Version`, `BuildDate`, `Copyright`) — guarded by the `AUTO-VERSION` marker comment.
- `VERSION` file, `README.md` `<!-- VERSION -->` / `<!-- DATE -->` markers.
- `B4Browse.csproj` `<Version>` / `<Copyright>` (drive the exe's file/product version).

`AppInfo` is the runtime source for the version shown in-app.

## Conventions
- Files are flat in the repo root, one top-level type per file, `B4Browse` namespace.
- Each check is self-contained and exception-isolated — a failing check returns a
  `Fail` result rather than throwing across the report.
- Background-action failures (an agent that times out, writes stderr, exits non-zero, or
  returns unparseable output) are recorded to `ErrorLog` instead of being swallowed by the
  runners' `return null`. A script that legitimately returns nothing (exit 0, no stderr) is
  **not** logged — only real failures are, so the `⚠ N errors` badge stays meaningful. The GUI
  surfaces them via the badge → `ErrorLogDialog`; headless `--run` flushes them to stderr.
- Headless progress goes to **stderr**, the report to **stdout** (so stdout stays clean).
- Dependencies: `System.Management` (WMI), `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` (reads the Windows
  Search `AppsIndex.db` for the Activity tab — its bundled native SQLite supplies the FTS5
  module that database needs — and counts rows in Chrome's `Login Data` for the Settings
  tab), and `ManagedEsent` (reads the SRUM ESE database `SRUDB.dat` for the Downloads tab)
  are the only NuGet packages.
