# Browse Safe — project index

Windows desktop utility (C# WinForms) that verifies the network and OS are in a safe
state before browsing. Two jobs: (1) confirm the network path is clean — no rogue proxy,
no DNS hijack/spoof; (2) surface files/extensions/programs/processes/services/drivers that
changed recently but don't line up with a Windows patch date. Runs a Safety Scan on startup
and presents results across sortable, color-coded tabs. Also runs headless to print a
plain-text report. See `README.md` for the user-facing feature tour.

- **Framework:** .NET 10 (`net10.0-windows`), WinForms, nullable + implicit usings enabled.
- **Namespace / assembly:** `BrowseSafe`. Single project, flat directory (no subfolders).
- **Author:** Dennis Lang — LanDen Labs (2026). Apache-2.0.

## Build & run

```pwsh
dotnet build                       # or open BrowseSafe.sln in Visual Studio
dotnet run                         # launch the GUI (Safety Scan runs on first show)
BrowseSafe.exe --run <scope>       # headless: run checks, print text report to stdout
BrowseSafe.exe --report            # alias for --run scan
BrowseSafe.exe --inventory         # alias for --run all
BrowseSafe.exe --run events --out events.txt   # also write report to a file
```

Scopes: `scan, dns, arp, patches, chrome, services, processes, startup, installed,
devices, winext, events, activity, firewall, restores, all` (the catalog in `Reports.cs` is the
source of truth). `events` needs Administrator to read the Security log.

`install.bat` publishes a self-contained single-file exe (`win-x64`) and copies it to
`c:\opt\bin`. All runtime assets (icon, brand images, links page) are embedded, so the
single file is portable.

## Architecture

The whole app is built on one small data model and a central catalog:

- **`CheckResult.cs`** — the model. `CheckStatus` enum (`Pass/Warn/Fail/Info`),
  `CheckResult` (one line: status + name + detail, or a pre-formatted `Table` row), and
  `CheckGroup` (a titled list of results; `Worst()` rolls up severity, table rows excluded).
- **`SafetyChecks`** — all diagnostic logic, a `static partial class` split across 14
  files (see below). Every public `CheckXxx()` method returns a populated `CheckGroup`
  and is safe to call from a background thread.
- **`Reports.cs`** — central catalog mapping each scope key → its `Func<CheckGroup>[]`
  producers, in display order. `Reports.Build(scope)` runs the producers and formats the
  plain-text report (isolating each check so one failure becomes a `[FAIL]` line, not an
  abort). Shared by the headless runner and the email feature. **Add a new check here**
  to wire it into both headless reports and (via the same catalog) the UI tabs.
- **`Program.cs`** — entry point. Parses `--run/--report/--inventory/--out/--help`;
  headless paths call `Reports.Build`. GUI path loads `Theme` then runs `MainForm`.
  Re-attaches to the parent console (`AttachConsole`) so a WinExe app can print headless
  output to the terminal.

### UI layer
- **`MainForm.cs`** — main window: verdict banner, toolbar (Launch Chrome, Email tab,
  Copy), collapsible left panel of Windows Security deep-links, and a `TabControl` where
  each tab is a `ResultsView`.
- **`ResultsView.cs`** — a single tab: runs its set of checks on a background thread and
  renders the resulting `CheckGroup`s.
- **`TabViews.cs`** — the large file (per-tab grid construction + right-click context
  menus: verify signature, VirusTotal-by-hash, copy path, open the relevant Windows
  console, etc.). One `ShowXxxMenu` per item type.
- **`SortableGrid.cs`** — custom sortable, themeable grid control used by the tabs.
- **`TabHelp.cs` / `TabSeverity.cs` / `Help.cs` / `AboutForm.cs` / `BusyOverlay.cs`** —
  per-tab help text, severity legend, help/about dialogs, busy overlay.
- **`Theme.cs`** — light/dark theme (toggle bottom-left); loaded before any window shows.

### SafetyChecks partials (the checks)
| File | Produces |
| --- | --- |
| `SafetyChecks.cs` | DNS servers, lookups, cross-resolver, email DNS, well-known resolver table |
| `SafetyChecks.Network.cs` | Router/gateway, upstream resolver, proxy, hosts file |
| `SafetyChecks.Posture.cs` | Time sync, Windows Security state |
| `SafetyChecks.System.cs` | OS / patch posture |
| `SafetyChecks.DnsCache.cs` | Live resolver cache (`ipconfig /displaydns`) + flush |
| `SafetyChecks.Arp.cs` | ARP cache |
| `SafetyChecks.ChromePrefs.cs` | Chrome exe integrity, privacy prefs, extensions |
| `SafetyChecks.Inventory.cs` | Services, processes, startup, installed, devices (largest) |
| `SafetyChecks.Winget.cs` | winget-sourced install metadata |
| `SafetyChecks.WinExt.cs` | Shell / context-menu extensions |
| `SafetyChecks.Firewall.cs` | Firewall state + rules |
| `SafetyChecks.Events.cs` | Windows Event Log entries |
| `SafetyChecks.Activity.cs` | App launch counts (Windows Search `AppsIndex.db`) + PCA last-run merge |
| `SafetyChecks.Restore.cs` | System Restore points |

### Row model / DTO classes
One small record-like class per item type, consumed by the grids:
`AppActivity`, `ArpEntry`, `ChromeExtension`, `DeviceDriver`, `DnsCacheEntry`, `EventItem`,
`FirewallRule`, `InstalledProgram`, `ProcessItem`, `RestorePoint`, `ServiceInfo`,
`ShellExtension`, `StartupItem`.

### Helpers
- `Elevation.cs` — admin/elevation detection.
- `EmbeddedAssets.cs` — load embedded icon/images (works inside the single-file exe).
- `InfAnalyzer.cs` — parse/analyze driver `.inf` files (driver tab "Analyze INF").
- `ReportMailer.cs` — "Email this tab (Chrome)".
- `ShellExtension.cs` — shell-extension lookup support.

## Versioning — keep in sync

Version lives in several places; **do not hand-edit them individually**.
`set-version.ps1` is the single source that rewrites all of them on release:
- `AppInfo.cs` (`Version`, `BuildDate`, `Copyright`) — guarded by the `AUTO-VERSION` marker comment.
- `VERSION` file, `README.md` `<!-- VERSION -->` / `<!-- DATE -->` markers.
- `BrowseSafe.csproj` `<Version>` / `<Copyright>` (drive the exe's file/product version).

`AppInfo` is the runtime source for the version shown in-app.

## Conventions
- Files are flat in the repo root, one top-level type per file, `BrowseSafe` namespace.
- Each check is self-contained and exception-isolated — a failing check returns a
  `Fail` result rather than throwing across the report.
- Headless progress goes to **stderr**, the report to **stdout** (so stdout stays clean).
- Dependencies: `System.Management` (WMI) and `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` (reads the Windows
  Search `AppsIndex.db` for the Activity tab; its bundled native SQLite supplies the FTS5
  module that database needs) are the only NuGet packages.
