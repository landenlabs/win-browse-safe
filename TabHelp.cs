            "\n" +
            "## 1. Current DNS Servers\n" +
            "Lists the DNS server each active adapter is set to use, naming any well-known public resolver " +
            "(Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, ...). A local/router address or a recognised public resolver is " +
            "normal - this section is the informational baseline the later DNS checks build on.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "## 2. Connected Router\n" +
            "Identifies your default gateway (the router): its IP, its MAC address and hardware vendor (from " +
            "the OUI), and - when the router answers UPnP - its make, model and firmware. Knowing the " +
            "gateway's real MAC helps you notice if it ever changes unexpectedly. On a Wi-Fi connection it " +

            "you're actually on.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "## 3. Actual Upstream DNS Resolver\n" +
            "Looks past the router to the resolver that actually answers out on the public internet, by asking " +
            "a \"whoami\" DNS server which IP reached it. This reveals the true upstream resolver even when " +
            "your router quietly forwards queries, so a resolver you didn't choose stands out.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "## 4. DNS Lookup Tests (public sites)\n" +
            "Resolves a handful of well-known sites (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Wikipedia, ...) and times each. " +

            "Resolves the same sites again through three independent public resolvers (Cloudflare, Quad9, " +
            "Google) and compares their answers with your local result. Agreement is reassuring; a local " +

            "CDN and geographic differences are expected and labelled as such, not failures.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "## 6. Hosts File\n" +
            "Reads C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts - the local file that can override DNS for any " +
            "name. Entries that redirect external sites are surfaced, since malware and adware commonly plant " +
            "them here. Use [ Open hosts folder ] to reveal the file in Explorer.\n" +

            "Looks up the mail servers (MX records) for Gmail and Yahoo and verifies each designated host both " +
            "belongs to the provider's real mail infrastructure and resolves to a public IP. A mismatch or a " +
            "non-public address can indicate DNS tampering aimed at intercepting mail.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "## 8. Proxy Configuration\n" +
            "Checks every place a proxy can hide - the WinINET per-user settings Chrome uses, a PAC " +
            "auto-config URL, WPAD auto-detect, the HTTP(S)_PROXY environment variables, and what the system " +

            "traffic, so a manual proxy is flagged FAIL.\n" +

            "Compares your PC clock against public NTP time servers. A large skew breaks TLS certificate " +
            "validation (HTTPS may fail or become easier to spoof) and can itself be a sign of tampering, so " +

            "registered antivirus) with its real-time protection and signature age, the firewall profiles, and " +
